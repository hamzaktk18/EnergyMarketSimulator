Created a broker to take in bids and provide power to customers

This code was part of CSC 486 - Sustainable Computing class and I created a platform for brokers to receive bids from wholesalers and sell electric power in certain quantities to consumers. 
Used Linear Regression from sklearn module to predict price. 
If the class had conitnued longer, the next step would've been to run the broker in my browser and create a game on my localhost.
